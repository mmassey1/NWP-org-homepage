								<h4>Hello, we are Nereids Water Protection!</h4> A grassroots organization dedicated to restoring the glory and beauty of New York's esteemed historical landmark, the Hudson River.			</div>

			<div class="column" >
			<p>Today, 200 miles of the Hudson River is classified by EPA as a Superfund site – one of the largest in the country.</p>
<p>
				Superfund is an EPA project dedicated to cleaning up America’s moat contaminated lands, and the Hudson River is classified as one of them. <br>
During a 30-year period ending in 1977, when EPA banned the production of PCBs, it is estimated that approximately 1.3 million pounds of PCBs were discharged into the Hudson River.
<span id="dots">...</span> 
<span id="more"><br>However, the Hudson River was not like this. In fact, for most of its history, 10,000 years to be exact, humans coexisted with the river and depended on it heavily, and thus were adamnant to protect it. <br>
It wasn't until about 400 years ago, when the English explorer Henry Hudson made contact with the river, did the river undergo serious mistreatment. <br>
Fpr the duration of these 4 centuries, the Hudson River has faced immense pollution, withb the height of this pollution occuring in the 20th century, when  General Electric dumping an estimated 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Hudson River between 1947 and 1977, leading to it being the contaminated waste land we have now.

<h3>Why Nereids?</h3>
<p>In Greek mythology, nereids are known as the spirits of rivers or seas, and the personification of the body of water itself. So, we chose the name "Nereids" to represent our dedication to taking care of the Hudson River, as if we were spirits of the river ourselves.</p>
